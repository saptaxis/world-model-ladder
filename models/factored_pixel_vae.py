"""Factored Pixel VAE — explicit [z_kin, z_ctx] latent split.

Inherits from PixelVAE. Same encoder architecture. The latent space is
split into z_kin (supervised kinematic dims) and z_ctx (unsupervised
context dims). Two decoder variants:

  concat: decode(concat(z_kin, z_ctx)) — same as parent. Split is loss-only.
  film: z_ctx → features, FiLM(features, z_kin) → frame. Kinematics
        multiplicatively modulates appearance, forcing the encoder to
        put rendering-relevant kinematics into z_kin.

The key difference from PixelVAE with a state_head: predict_state(z)
returns a SLICE of z (zero perception noise from the head itself), not
a neural network output. The encoder must learn to place GT kinematic
values directly into the designated z dims.

Design spec: traitful-docs/.../specs/factored-pixel-world-model.md
E3 Finding 04: angle is the load-bearing kinematic — kin_targets enables
ablation of which dims to supervise (e.g., angle-only = [4, 5]).
